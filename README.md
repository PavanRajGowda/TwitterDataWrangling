# TwitterDataWrangling
In this Udacity Data Analyst project, I gained experience with the wrangling process. I gathered Data from a CSV file, from Twitter using the API, and from Udacity Servers using the Python Request Library. I then went on to assess the data for quality and tideness issues. Once I identified problems, I was able to adress them efficiently using python and pandas. At the end, I was able to generate interesting visualizations that provided insights on the WeRateDogs Twitter page.
